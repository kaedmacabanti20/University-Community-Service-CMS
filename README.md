## The Problem 

At the University of the Assumption, students need to complete 40 hours of community service to graduate. Right now, they use paper log cards to keep track of their attendance. These cards are signed by an activity coordinator to confirm their participation.

1. Some students might ask friends to sign their log cards without actually attending the event.

2. Students sometimes forget their log cards at home, so they can't get them signed.

3. Log cards can be lost over time, leading students to do extra community service to make up for the lost hours.

## The Web-based Solution

1. Instead of using paper log cards, students can use their student ID, which has a barcode. Coordinators can scan this barcode with a web-based scanner when students attend events. This way, students only need to bring their ID.

2. University admins can set up activity links for each event. Coordinators can open these links on their phones to access the barcode scanner.

3. Students can check their total service hours on a portal by entering their student ID.

## Interface

The software has 3 types of user and interface
1. Student
2. Activity Coordinator
3. University Admin (Community Extension Office)

## Inspiration
The university students, admins, coordinators are familiar with google meet and it's simple function. Thus the interface and core features is based on its simplicity.
